# Eloquent JavaScript

Over the next few days (weeks) I'll be building out this repository. My intent
is to create a `file.js` for each chapter and project. Eloquent JavaScript
has a soft introduction to the approaches of a CS book, then goes over the
unique aspects of JavaScript as a client side language.

For now I recommend utilizing these notes on the server side project, utilizing
Node, as that is the way it is being developed.

## Running Locally

Install Node, if you're using OS X and have [Homebrew][1] installed: `brew
install node`. To review a particular file, simply type `node file_to_test.js`
in to your terminal.

# Eloquent JavaScript

Over the next few weeks I'll be building out this repository. My intent
is to create a `file.js` for each chapter and project. I chose to work through
Eloquent JavaScript because of it's approach, there are more chapters spent on
general computer science than actual web development.

I'll be developing my solutions for each chapter locally, using Node. Some
chapter problems are dependent on data in accompanying files. Because of
this, if you are to clone this repository and test my solutions, I recommend
doing so using Node.

## Running Locally

Install [Node][1], this can be done from their website. Alternatively if you're
on OS X and have [Homebrew][2] installed: `brew install node`. To review a
particular file, simply type `node file_to_test.js` in to your terminal.

# Eloquent JavaScript

To further perfect my JavaScript skill set I chose to work through
Eloquent JavaScript. Though most of the book will be a review, I enjoy the
computer science approach maintained by the first half of the book.

I'll be developing my solutions for each chapter locally, using Node. Some
chapter problems are dependent on data in accompanying files. Because of
this, if you are to clone this repository and test my solutions, I recommend
doing so using Node.

## Running Locally

Install [Node][1], this can be done from their website. Alternatively if you're
on OS X and have [Homebrew][2] installed: `brew install node`. To review a
particular file, simply type `node file_to_test.js` in to your terminal.
